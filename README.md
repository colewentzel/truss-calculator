# truss-calculator

MATLAB code to calculate forces within a truss. Written by Cole Wentzel for a university project.

### Functionality
+ Calculate the cost of a given truss based on cost per joint and material used.
+ Customize joint locations and members connections.
+ Input file to simplify parameter input. 

### How to Use
+ Edit the values in `trussInput.m` and run generate a .mat file. The variables in this file can be used to run `truss.m` and get the output.
